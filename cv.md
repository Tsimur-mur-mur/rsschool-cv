### Work experience, skills and motivation
My previous work experience was related to providing user support for various products. I have worked with products in the gambling industry, robotics, and e-commerce about 4 years in total. In order to advance my career and personal development, I have decided to learn JavaScript/Front-end. This will help me tackle more complex tasks within the support industry or qualify for more attractive positions. I am confident that during the learning process, qualities such as perseverance, meticulousness, curiosity, and responsibility will assist me in successfully mastering the material. As confirmation, I provide an example of a task I have mastered on the Codewars registration stage:\
```function multiply(a, b){
return a * b
}```\
